# password-manager

Project in which I am showing what I have learned recently
- using functions
- using oop (class), constructors
- operations on strings
- databases - creating db and tables, receiving and inserting data
- password hashing in python, checking if password is entered correctly
- using python libraries
- researching things

What I have learned from this project
- Definitely I need to create structure of my project at the beginning, I should have created To-Do-List with task to do, instead of doing things without plan
